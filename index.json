Two external test cohorts were enrolled—the first based on the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) database (n=353) and the second being a clinical deployment cohort (n=31)—to assess the DeepPET-OPSCC performance and goodness of fit.\nDemo Code: The DeepPET-OPSCC demo could be found here\nRef   Deep Learning for Fully Automated Prediction of Overall Survival in Patients with Oropharyngeal Cancer Using FDG-PET Imaging, Clinical Cancer Research, 2021, OnlineFirst.

Several deep survival learning models are proposed for predicting the surivals of cancer patients from the provided multi-modal data of patients.\nTechnological advances create a great opportunity to provide multi-view data for patients including 3D/4D radiological imaging, High resolutional pathological slides, gene expression, etc. For example in imaging data, traditional surival models mainly rely on explicitly-designed handcrafted features. This process highly relies on domain expert and human intervention which could introduce human bias and limit the use on large scale data.\nDeep learning have been successfully used in many medical imaging problem including detection, classification, segmentation. Survival prediction describes how patients will survival in the future. Depend on the event, it also includes the predication of Overall Survival (OS), Disease Free Survival (DFS) or other prognostic factor prediction.
